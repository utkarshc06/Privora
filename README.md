🔐 PRIVORA

Privacy-Controlled Document Sharing & Secure Printing System

“Share the document, but never lose control over it.”

PRIVORA is a secure document sharing and controlled printing system designed to protect sensitive documents when users need to print them through external Xerox/printing centres.

Instead of simply sending a document to a printing centre, PRIVORA allows the document owner to define who can print, where it can be printed, how many copies can be printed, and how long the request remains valid.


📌 Problem Statement

Organizations and individuals often need to print confidential documents through external Xerox or printing centres when an in-house printer is unavailable.

This creates several problems:

- 🔓 Risk of unauthorized access to confidential documents
- 📄 No proper control over how many copies are printed
- 🗑️ Uncertainty about document handling after printing
- 🔑 No additional authorization before printing
- ⏳ Documents may remain accessible longer than required
- 📋 Manual management of printing requests and queues
- 👥 Difficulty in tracking printing activities

PRIVORA addresses these problems by introducing a secure, rule-based and trackable printing workflow.


💡 Our Solution

PRIVORA creates a secure connection between:

Document Owner → Xerox Centre → Physical Printer → Admin

The user uploads a document and defines printing rules before sending it to a selected Xerox centre.

The Xerox operator can process the request only according to the permissions defined by the user.

Core Concept

«The user controls the document.
PRIVORA enforces the rules.
The Xerox centre performs the print.»

🔐 Security Architecture

Security is one of the core components of PRIVORA.

AES-256-GCM

Used to encrypt sensitive documents before they are transferred/stored.

AES-256-GCM provides:

- Confidentiality
- Data integrity
- Secure authenticated encryption


RSA-2048 / OAEP

Used for secure protection of encryption keys.

This provides an additional asymmetric cryptography layer for key protection.

SHA-256

Used for secure hashing of sensitive values such as PIN-related data.

Passwords/PINs should not be stored directly as plain text.


🔑 PIN-Based Authorization

A valid print request alone is not sufficient to print the document.

The authorized PIN must be verified before the document proceeds to the printing stage.

🛡️ Role-Based Access Control

PRIVORA separates permissions according to user roles:

USER
 │
 ├── Upload Documents
 ├── Create Requests
 ├── Set Print Rules
 └── Track Requests


XEROX CENTRE
 │
 ├── Receive Requests
 ├── Verify PIN
 ├── Process Documents
 └── Print


ADMIN
 │
 ├── Monitor Users
 ├── Monitor Centres
 ├── Monitor Requests
 └── View System Analytics


🖨️ Controlled Printing

One of PRIVORA's main features is print-limit enforcement.

For example:

User sets:

Print Limit = 2

The system allows:

Print #1 → Allowed
Print #2 → Allowed
Print #3 → Blocked

Therefore, the Xerox operator does not independently decide the number of copies.

PRIVORA enforces the print rule defined by the document owner.


⏱️ Document Expiration

The user can define how long a printing request should remain valid.

Example:

Request Created
      ↓
Valid for 10 minutes
      ↓
10 Minutes Completed
      ↓
Request Expired
      ↓
Further Processing Blocked

This reduces the period during which a sensitive document remains available for processing.


📋 Request Management

Instead of depending entirely on manual communication at the Xerox centre, PRIVORA creates digital print requests.

Typical request lifecycle:

PENDING
   ↓
ACCEPTED
   ↓
APPROVED
   ↓
PRINTING
   ↓
COMPLETED

This makes the printing workflow easier to monitor and helps organize multiple incoming requests.


☁️ Cloud & Backend

PRIVORA uses cloud services to support authentication, data management and protected document storage.

Firebase Authentication

Used for:

- User authentication
- Login management
- Identity verification

Firebase Firestore

Used for storing and tracking application data such as:

- Users
- Xerox centres
- Print requests
- Request status
- Activities

Cloudinary

Used as the cloud storage layer for protected/encrypted document data.
